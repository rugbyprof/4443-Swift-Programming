### Locations Assignment
#### Due: 30 Mar by class time.

### Instructions:

So far in single page applications (with multiple views), and also using views embedded in `navigationViewControllers` we have:

- passed data "forward" to a `viewController` using `prepareForSegue`.
- passed data "backward" to a `viewController` using `protocols` and `delegates`

Your assignment is to use [MyLocations](https://github.com/rugbyprof/4443-Swift-Programming/tree/master/MyLocations) as a basis for passing data between 2 viewControllers that happen to both be embedded in the same tabViewController. 

For an example of how to do so, go here:

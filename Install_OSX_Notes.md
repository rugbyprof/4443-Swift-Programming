I have my normal use desktop up and running Yosemite, following the how-to that was posted. 
That how-to got the basics just fine, but you should note that:

- I have had to hunt down network, graphics, and audio drivers manually but that should be expected. 
- Overall install was fairly easy, finding drivers/modifying .kext files was a little harder. 
- Make sure the SATA setting in the BIOS is set to ACHI, else the hard drive wont display in the Drive Utility.
